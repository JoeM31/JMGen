# JMGen

This application was developed as an undergraduate dissertation for the BA Music Informatics course at The University of Sussex between September 2013 and June 2014.

JMGen is a generative music application built using visual coding language Processing and the music programming language SuperCollider. The application is a music creation tool that allows users to create music from automatically composed loops, which are represented by shapes in an intuitive user interface, which aims to be novel as well as engaging for a wide variety of interest and skill levels in music.

To use the source code:

1. Install Processing libraries OscP5 and G4P which are available here: (OscP5 : http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/ & G4P: http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/download.html)

2. Move the whole “JMGen” folder to the SuperCollider extensions folder, normally found at Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions on a Mac.

3. Open SuperCollider and compile the class library, and boot the server.

4. Open the Processing project JMGen.pde and run it before running any SuperCollider code.

5. Evaluate the code in file “Startup.scd”
